I was a cellist in my school orchestra for a number of years. Through years of learning and practice, I learned to play with confidence, to be expressive with my instrument, to feel the emotion hidden in the music; and in the process, realizing that I did not need to be afraid of making mistakes. I also improved my ability to multi-tasking. While playing, I had to watch the conductor, stay in tempo with the conductor, make sure I am in tune with my section, listen to the other sections for sound cues, read my sheet music, and have the coordination to do all this while making sure I play the correct notes. Having good teamwork was a must in orchestra. I had to learn from the constructive criticism given to me and be able to give out helpful constructive critisism. I needed to learn how to take instructions from a leader (teacher, senior classmates) and how to give instructions as a leader (to my peers).

Throughout the years, my high school orchestra performed regularly in our own school, inter-school concerts, anuual events, and festive performances in public places. In 2019 we even got invited to perform at Carnegie Hall, New York in April 2021. Unfortunately, due to the Covid epidemic, the concert was eventually cancelled. But in this, I learned another valuable lesson. There are times when our goal seems within our grasp, then suddenly, something happens that is out of our control and it is being taken away. I learned to dust myself off of disappointment and strive towards my next goal.
