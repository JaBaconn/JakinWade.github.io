## A Newbie's View On Java Script

As a newbie to Java Script, I find the experience pretty interesting. This is my first time learning a coding language that is not object oriented (like C/C++, Java). The way JavaScript uses functions is very flexible since it uses functions like a variable, e.g - a string. Its ability to assign a function to variables, pass it as arguments to other functions, store it in data structures, & return it from other functions; I find these advantages very helpful. However Java Script a bit hard to understand for complete beginners.

## A Newbie's View on WODs

I find the WODs we do quite helpful. Although a bit stressful, I believe the “all or nothing” grading format of these WODs add a weight and urgency to them. As my mother always told me, “There are times in the real world where you just cannot afford to make any mistakes.” I feel like these WODs simulate a similar situation where a simple mistake such as missing a deadline by a few hours could have massive setbacks. I believe this is essential training for us students.

## A Newbie's Experience

Back in 2015, when I just started middle school, I signed up for the school orchestra as a cellist. There was an annual event, around April called the "Parade of Orchestras." This was an event where middle schools and high schools from all across Oahu would perform. Although this was a non-competitive event, each school would get their performance graded by a few judges. 

Fast forward to April of 2016, I find myself being the only cellist able to perform. This is only my first year learning cello!! Now I have to solo in front of 200 people?!? "Sometimes, you just cannot make mistakes." My mother's words echoed throughout my head as I prepared for my first big performance ever. Cold sweat starts to form, my hands are freezing but at the same time, sweaty. Feelings I have never felt before running through my body as I prepare to play my first note.

Thankfully, I managed to compose my self and get in the grove. The performace went without a hitch, even scoring us an "Excellent" grading, only second to the highest grading: "Superb".

I believe it is these experiences that temper a person's mind. Having the experience of being put under immense pressure with the expectation to do well.
