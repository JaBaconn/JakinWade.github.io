<a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> is the worldâ€™s most popular front-end web development framework, it is based on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It is basically a massive library of tools to help you control, refine, and customize page elements. Bootstrap contains typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components such as maps & templates. Here are a some free resources that Bootstrap offers: <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">StartBootstrap</a>, <a href="https://themefisher.com/free-bootstrap-templates/">ThemeFisher</a>, <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com">BootstrapMade</a>. There are a few advantages that come from using Bootstrap, such as simplification. Bootstrap simplifies the tedious task of resizing images and elements. Instead of a developer going through the trouble of manually scripting these elements, Bootstrap handles it effortlessly, saving you quite a bit of time. Plus, websites created with Bootstrap are automatically optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

## My Experience With Bootstrap
I have found Bootstraps library of tools very helpful and useful. It makes things so much easier, for example, making a navigation bar. In raw HTML and CSS, you would need to code your "ul" section and then go into your linked stylesheet and manually coding everything. On the contrary, in Bootstrap you can just put a "nav" section, then put a "div container", then put your "ul" and "li", and BOOM, you have a navigation bar; you didn't need to go into CSS and mess with padding or manually coding your text into a straight line. So why not just make your life 5 times easier by using Bootstrap? Besides requiring a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, there are almost no downsides to Bootstrap.
