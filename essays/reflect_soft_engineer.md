## Design Patterns

### What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are a fundamental part of software development, as they provide typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in software design. Rather than providing specific pieces of software, design patterns are merely concepts that can be used to handle recurring themes in an optimized way.

I’ve learned that design patterns are everywhere and not just limited to software engineering, we just don’t realize it sometimes.

### For example:

- **Architecture:** In architecture, design patterns help architects solve common problems in building design. Patterns like the "open floor plan" or "central courtyard" are examples.

- **Instructional Design:** In education and training, instructional designers use patterns like the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) to create effective learning experiences.

- **Business Processes:** In business management, patterns like Six Sigma or Lean Manufacturing offer standardized approaches to process improvement and efficiency.

- **Writing and Storytelling:** Narrative patterns like the Hero's Journey or the Three-Act Structure are common in literature and storytelling.

## Coding Standards

### What are Coding Standards?
Coding standards are a set of guidelines and best practices that developers follow when writing code. These standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on a project and for future maintenance and debugging. 

### Coding Standards Elsewhere
Coding standards can be applied to other tasks. For example, it can be integrated into educational curricula and training programs to teach students best practices in writing, data management, design, and process optimization. By instilling these standards early on, educators prepare students for success in diverse fields and promote professionalism in their work. It can also be incorporated into creative industries such as graphic design, advertising, and multimedia production. Following coding standards principles can improve workflow efficiency and collaboration. Consistent file naming, version control, and asset management practices streamline the creative process and ensure deliverables meet client expectations.
