## Are Coding Standards Useful?

Yes, I believe they are useful. For example, comments: meaningful comments explaining code functionality, especially in complex or non-obvious sections, to aid understanding for other developers or future reference. Although you mainly write comments for other developers, I believe that in the process, you can gain a better understanding of the code yourself. How can you explain to others if you yourself do not understand it?

## First Impressions of IntelliJ & ESLint

I found IntelliJ very useful. There are so many tools within IntelliJ at your disposal, you will get overwhelmed. If that wasnâ€™t enough, you can also download external plugins such as WakaTime. It is like a fitness tracker but for monitoring your coding activity. The WakaTime plugin provides a time tracking service while automatically generating neat and appealing metrics and insights. You can use it for analyzing team productivity or for finding ways to improve your own programming pace.

ESLint is also very helpful. It is a code analysis tool for identifying errors found in your JavaScript code. It helps catch errors, enforce coding conventions, and improve code quality and maintainability. It is highly configurable, allowing developers to define and enforce coding standards and best practices within their projects.
